*Fine scale* ocean dynamics plays a key role in the climate machinery through various scale interaction mechanisms. Fine-scale ocean dynamics refer to ocean physical processes occuring at scales smaller than 200km, in the open ocean. This includes a fraction of *mesoscale* processes, with scales close to the first internal Rossby radius (20 to 200km). At mesoscales, oceans are populated by waves motions and coherent eddies, that contribute actively to transporting matter across ocean basins and from equator to poles. Fine scale processes also comprise *submesoscale* processes, with scale smaller than the first internal Rossby radius (1-20km). At submesoscales, oceans are populated by intense vortices, fronts and filaments, all of which are contributing to vertical exchanges between the ocean interior and the surface, fluxing in particular nutrients from the ocean sub-surface to the sun-lit surface layers where primary production occurs. 

Overall, fine-scale dynamics is also key because the energy injected by winds in the large ocean circulation is fluxed through fine-scale processes on its way toward dissipation at smaller scale. Knowing how and and where energy is being exchanged in the ocean provides a key constrain for projecting the future evolution of the oceans.

Over the past 20 years, the combination of satellite remote sensing and ocean models have shown the ubiquity of ocean fine-scale processes and the key role they are playing in the climate machinery, but numerous essential key questions are still unanswered and fine-scale processes are still challenging to represent realistically in ocean models. The MEOM team contributes to unravel the rich variety of ocean processes occuring at fine scales by *improving the representation of fine-scale dynamics in ocean models* and *developping innovative procedures for revealing the signature of fine scale dynamics in in-situ and satellite observations*. Because we believe in the complementarity of observational and modelling efforts we use realistics ocean models, as for instance our new North Atlantic 1/60Â° NEMO model configuration to study how new observational plateforms may inform about fine scale processes. 


On-going activities on fine-scales dynamics in our group are accompagnying and preparing new satellite ocean observation missions, such as the CNES/ISRO SARAL/AltiKA mission (launched in 2013), the future CNES/NASA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission to be launched in 2021 and the geostationary ocean color OCAPI mission. We contribute actively to the scientific definition of these missions and to the preparation of innovative inversion and data assimilation methods that will help improve the observability of fine scales with these instruments. We also pursue the development of image assimilation techniques for sea surface temperature and ocean color data, that are available at a kilometric resolution from existing satellites.
